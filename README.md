# AOC-2021

My solutions for advent of code, 2021. All solutions will probably be in C++, but I will try adding Rust solutions later on as well. Since this is my first time doing AOC, I will be focussing on trying to get the answer & not focus too much on writing clean code. This includes me formatting the given input to avoid parsing the given input. \
